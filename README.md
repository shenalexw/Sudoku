## Abstract

The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.

The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.

The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square, must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.

This python file allows the users to solve any sudoku puzzle as well as recieve a sudoku puzzle based on selected difficulty.
