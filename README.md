# Sudoku

Goals:

- Simulate the game of Sudoku through Python.
- Create a GUI that allows you to input numbers.
- Create a solver so that it will solve any given puzzle.
- Create an auto-generated sudoku that is solvable.

The Rules of Sudoku:

The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.

The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.

The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square, must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.

There must be at least 17 clues in order to have a puzzle with one unique solution.
