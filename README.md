# Sudoku
### Abstract:

Sudoku.py runs a text based sudoku generator and allows the user to enter their difficulty level in the console. Once 
selected the console will display an unsolved puzzle followed by the solution.

Try out my text based sudoku simulator in the repl.it link below.

### Goals for This Project:

- Simulate the game of Sudoku through Python.
- Create a GUI that allows you to input numbers.
- Create a solver so that it will solve any given puzzle.
- Create an auto-generated sudoku that is solvable.

### The Rules of Sudoku:

The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares.

The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box.

The difficulty lies in that each vertical nine-square column, or horizontal nine-square line across, within the larger square, must also contain the numbers 1-9, without repetition or omission.

There must be at least 17 clues in order to have a puzzle with one unique solution.
